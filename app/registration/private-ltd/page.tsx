                 <p className="text-muted-foreground text-justify mb-4">
                  In India, a private limited company is a privately held entity
                  with limited liability, and it ranks among the nation's most
                  favored business structures. This popularity is primarily
                  attributed to its numerous advantages, including limited
                  liability protection, ease of formation and maintenance, and its
                  status as a distinct legal entity. This encourages a prospective
                  businessman to engage in the incorporation of private limited
                  company. A private limited company enjoys legal separation from
                  its owners and necessitates a minimum of two members and two
                  directors for its operation. Here are the key characteristics of
                  a private limited company in India, which justify the PVT LTD
                  company registration:
