                <p className="text-muted-foreground text-justify mb-4">
                  A business tax return refers to an income tax return for
                  businesses. A business income tax return is a comprehensive
                  report that outlines a business's income, expenses, and
                  pertinent tax details, all presented in a designated form. It
                  entails the submission of income tax returns for businesses,
                  with the added requirement of reporting Tax Deducted at Source
                  (TDS). This process must be carried out annually.

                  components like fixed assets, loans obtained, loans extended,
                  debtors, and creditors within the business. It is important to
                  meet the income tax return filing last date for business.

                  Any individual with business income is said to be operating a
                  proprietorship firm. Proprietorships operating in India are
                  required to file income tax returns each year. Since
                  proprietorships are considered the same as proprietors, a
                  proprietorship's income tax return filing procedure is similar
                  to individual income tax return filing.

                    All proprietors below 60 years are required to file income tax
                    returns if total income exceeds Rs. 2.5 lakhs. For proprietors
                    over 60 years but below 80 years, income tax filing is mandatory
                    if total income exceeds Rs.3 lakhs. Proprietors over 80 years
