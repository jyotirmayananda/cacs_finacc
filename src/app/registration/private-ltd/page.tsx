                <p className="mt-4 text-muted-foreground text-justify">
                    In India, a private limited company is a privately held entity with limited liability, and it ranks among the nation's most favored business structures. This popularity is primarily attributed to its numerous advantages, including limited liability protection, ease of formation and maintenance, and its status as a distinct legal entity. This encourages a prospective businessman to engage in the incorporation of private limited company. A private limited company enjoys legal separation from its owners and necessitates a minimum of two members and two directors for its operation. Here are the key characteristics of a private limited company in India, which justify the PVT LTD company registration:
